## ðŸ“¦ Managing Dotfiles with Stow

This repository uses [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage dotfiles. Stow creates symlinks from your home directory to the files in this repository.

### Basic Usage

To stow all configurations:

```bash
stow -t $HOME .
```

To stow specific configurations:

```bash
stow -t $HOME nvim    # Stow only Neovim config
stow -t $HOME zsh     # Stow only Zsh config
```

### Unstowing

To remove symlinks:

```bash
stow -D -t $HOME .    # Remove all symlinks
stow -D -t $HOME nvim # Remove only Neovim symlinks
```

### Restowing

To update symlinks after changes:

```bash
stow -R -t $HOME .    # Restow all configurations
```
